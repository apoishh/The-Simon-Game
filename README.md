# The-Simon-Game
[The Simon game](https://apoishh.github.io/The-Simon-Game/) is an interactive web-based replica of the iconic electronic memory game, originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, and released by Milton Bradley (now Hasbro) in 1978. Experience the nostalgia and challenge your memory skills with this faithful recreation of the classic game on the web.

## How To Play

Players must pay close attention to the sequence, as their goal is to accurately replicate it. After the device plays the sequence, players must repeat it by pressing the buttons in the exact same order. If successful, the device responds with a longer sequence, adding an additional color to the pattern. The game continues in this manner, progressively increasing the complexity and length of the sequences, challenging players to push their memory limits.

However, a single mistake—pressing the wrong button or pressing a button out of order—results in a "game over" scenario, and players must start over from the beginning. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by correctly replicating the longest sequence of colors.
